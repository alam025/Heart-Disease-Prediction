❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
A machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. This project leverages classification algorithms and data visualization to build an interpretable and accurate model for early diagnosis and treatment.

🔍 Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. By analyzing patient data, machine learning can help identify risk factors and predict heart disease. This project focuses on:

Cleaning and preprocessing medical datasets.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Building and evaluating classification models.
Visualizing results to enhance interpretability.
📁 Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:

Age
Gender
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Resting Electrocardiographic Results, and more.
